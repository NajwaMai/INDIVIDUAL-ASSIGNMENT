  <h2>Designing Tomorrow: Exploring Multimedia and Graphic Design</h2>
  <p>
  Hi, My name is Najwa Maisarah Binti Shukri, i'm 22 years old this year. My dream is to become a professional graphic designer, crafting visual stories that inspire, inform, and captivate audiences across different platforms. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by the way color, typography, and layout can communicate powerful messages without saying a word. Whether it's designing logos, creating marketing materials, or developing digital content for brands, I want my work to reflect creativity, clarity, and purpose.
</p>
<p>
  I aspire to master tools like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma, and other design software that help bring imaginative ideas to life. I envision myself working in a fast-paced, innovative environment—collaborating with creative teams to build brand identities, user experiences, and visual campaigns that stand out in a competitive digital world. From branding to digital illustrations, I aim to create designs that leave a lasting impact on the world of media, marketing, and communication.
